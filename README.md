# LangGraph: Build Stateful Agentic AI graph

A **stateful agentic AI chatbot** built using **LangGraph**, demonstrating how to design, route, and manage multi-agent workflows using graph-based execution.

This project focuses on **agent orchestration**, **state management**, and **controlled AI behavior**, rather than a simple single-prompt chatbot.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AgenticChatbot** showcases how to build an **agentic AI system** where:
- Agents are nodes in a graph
- State flows across nodes
- Decisions determine the next execution path

Using **LangGraph**, the chatbot maintains context, handles branching logic, and executes actions in a controlled, explainable manner.

## 🧩 Why LangGraph?

Traditional LLM chains are linear.  
LangGraph enables:

- 🔄 **Stateful execution**
- 🧭 **Conditional routing**
- 🧠 **Multi-agent coordination**
- 🛑 **Controlled autonomy**
- 📊 **Graph-based reasoning flow**

This makes it ideal for **agentic systems**, **AI workflows**, and **production-grade AI agents**.

Each node reads and writes to a shared **state object**, enabling memory, control, and traceability.
